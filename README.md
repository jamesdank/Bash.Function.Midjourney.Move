<u>Things to edit:</u>

<b>ZIP_FOLDER</b></br>
This is the folder you will add the zip files that are downloaded from midjourney

<b>MIDJOURNEY_FOLDER</b></br>
This is the folder that the script will create a directory named the date and time it's created and the .png files will be moved into this directory.
